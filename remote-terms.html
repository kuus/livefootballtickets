<p>Here’s what we do at Live Football Tickets:</p>
<p>We have created an online marketplace to make hard-to-get tickets available to anyone providing quality customer service. Ticket prices on our site are determined by supply and demand (market value) by ticket specialists (the sellers). Since supply and
  demand are what drive the prices, today the prices can be low and tomorrow they may be higher, it can always change.</p>
<p>Fans need to place orders with LiveFootballTickets not only because we have a friendly customer service, leading security and a money back guarantee – they also come to us since it's so difficult to get tickets from the primary sources – especially for
  the biggest matches. So this is why those hard-to-get tickets are listed by the sellers above face value. Keep an eye out for deals though – sellers also provide tickets below face value when the market is full of tickets. can read more about us in
  our About Us section, however this section is to let you know what you're agreeing to when you place an order with us.</p>
<p>A contract (“buyer agreement, contract”) has been deemed as made between livefootballtickets.com and the buyer ("you, your, the client") when the client has confirmed requirements, by any medium, and livefootballtickets.com has accepted the order and
